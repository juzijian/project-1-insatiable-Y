The C++ programming language was incrementally developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in the early 1980s, originally as an extended C compiler named Cfront but eventually as an alternative. The language has gone under much revision and has been made standard with C++98. As of C++98, the language is completely compatible with C and adds some new constructs like classes, templates, and exception handling.
